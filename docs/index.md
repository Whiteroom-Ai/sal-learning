# SAL Documentation

Welcome to the Self-Alignment Learning documentation.

## Overview

SAL is a communication-based approach to neural network training that treats optimization as dialogue rather than control.

## Core Principles

- **Ask Before Updating** — Measure stability before modifying parameters
- **Protect What Has Emerged** — Stable patterns represent learned coherence
- **Grow Through Connection** — Learning happens through relationship, not force

## Modules

### [Principles](principles.md)
The philosophy behind SAL and why it matters.

### [Architecture](architecture.md)

### [How SAL Differs](how_sal_differs.md)

### [Visualizations](plots.md)
Visual explanations of SAL concepts.
